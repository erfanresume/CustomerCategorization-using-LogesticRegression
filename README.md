# CustomerCategorization-using-LogesticRegression
Customer categorization of a telecommunications provider using Logestic Regression
## Overview
- I will use a telecommunications dataset for predicting customer churn. This is a historical customer dataset where each row represents one customer. The data is relatively easy to understand, and you may uncover insights you can use immediately. Typically it is less expensive to keep customers than acquire new ones, so the focus of this analysis is to predict the customers who will stay with the company.
